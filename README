I have set up a sample user which is created by running deploy/deploy.py.

Username: user
Password: password


In testing the specific user's attributes were:

{u'username': u'user', 
u'password': u'bcbe6057130774568dbeafe30c50d9d787af419163eea37eed328bd2068f6bcc34dc9f5aecd464c34c3c93eb8f3aa11e59222e89311471f7f139ef4e64495792', 
u'edit_record': True, 
u'add_record': True, 
u'generate_report': False, 
u'remove_record': True, 
u'_id': ObjectId('51efb3447b68e73c5a89d1c3')}

Generate report is therefore the only api call that should fail.

I have not written tests. I would want to individually test each function, 
then I would want to write broader tests to test the functionality of whole sections.

This was run without a proper deployment of Flask - simply the dev server. I've done initial edge case user testing, but there are probably instances of 
exception handling that would need to be added.
